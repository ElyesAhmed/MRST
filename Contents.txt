This file briefly describes the content of the the ad-micp module. Inside
the root folder, you will find the following folders:

* examples,
* publications,
* models, and
* utility.

In addition, this file (Contents.txt), the content of the ad-micp module in MRST
type format (Contents.m), a copy of the license (LICENSE.txt), and the README
(README.md for the github site and README.txt in MRST type format).

The example folder contains four commented scripts to demonstrate how to set up
different flow system simulations using this module:

* run1DCase.m,
* run2DLeakageCase.m,
* run2DRadialCase.m, and
* run3DCase.m.

The publications folder contains two folders for reproducing the numerical
results in the manuscripts:

* paper_A and
* paper_B.

The paper_A folder contains the following folder and scripts:

* co2_assessment,
* micp_1Dfhs.m,
* micp_2Dfhcs.m,
* micp_2Dfhrs.m,
* micp_2Dfls.m,
* micp_2Dfvrs.m, and
* micp_3Dfls.m.

The co2_assessment folder contains the following scripts:

* CO2Model.m
* equationsCO2.m,
* getFluxAndPropsCO2.m, and
* getFluxAndPropsWater.m.

The paper_B folder contains the following scripts and folder:

* micp_mrst_opm.m and
* micp_opm_vtk.

The micp_opm_vtk folder contains the data obtained from the OPM simulations
to be used for plotting.

The models folder contains the parent class for declaring the MICP model:

* MICPModel.m.

Finally, in the utility folder, you will find the following functions:

* checkCloggingMICP.m,
* equationsMICP.m,
* getDispersionAnddpWMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsMICP.m,
* getPlotAfterStepCO2.m,
* getPlotAfterStepMICP.m, and
* mrsttovtk.m.
