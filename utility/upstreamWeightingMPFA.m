function [krwUp] = upstreamWeightingMPFA(G, bc, bcVal, mpfa_discr, krw, ...
    gamma, pot, typePot, grav)
% Computes the upstream weighting of the relative permeability
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function krwUp = upstreamWeightingMPFA(G, bc, bcVal, mpfa_discr, krw, gamma, pot, typePot, grav)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G           - Structure, Grid structure from MRST.
%   bc          - Structure, Boundary conditions structure from MRST
%   bcVal       - Vector, containing the values of boundary conditions.
%                 In the case Dirichlet conditions are prescribed and
%                 gravity effects considered, bcVal is composed by the 
%                 total contribution from both.
%   mpfa_discr  - Structure, MPFA discretization structure.
%   krw         - Function, relative permeability function krw = krw(psi)
%                 or krw = krw(p), according to the passed potential.
%   gamma       - Scalar, specific gravity, i.e., gamma = rho * g
%   pot         - Vector, containing the values of the potential. 
%   typePot     - String, type of potential. This could be either 'psi'
%                 for pressure head, or 'pressure' for pressure.
%   grav        - String, 'on' when gravity effects are included in the 
%                 model, and 'off' when they are not.
%
%  RETURNS:
%   krwUp       - Vector, containing the upstream weighted relative
%                 permeabilities at the faces.
