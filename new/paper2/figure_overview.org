- *There are issues with convergence for the rate-driven dissolution model.  There are also issues with plotting, which may or may not be related.*


* Other:
- the script 'dissolutionTopSurfaceExample1' doesn't seem to converge properly, and isn't used for any of the illustrations as far as I can see, so it is left out from the final compilation.
