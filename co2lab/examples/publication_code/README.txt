The directories correspond to the following research papers:

paper1/  : Spill Point Analysis and Structural Trapping Capacity in Saline
           Aquifers Using MRST-co2lab

paper2/  : Robust Simulation of Sharp-Interface Models for Fast Estimation of
           CO2 Trapping Capacity

paper3/  : Fully-Implicit Simulation of Vertical-Equilibrium Models with
           Hysteresis and Capillary Fringe (*)

paper4/  : Analysis of CO2 Trapping Capacities and Long-Term Migration for
           Geological Formations in the Norwegian North Sea Using MRST-co2lab (*)


The directories contain MATLAB code that can be used with co2lab to generate the
examples within.  Minor discrepancies may occur as a side effect of later code
maintenance.  

The articles marked with (*) has not yet all code prepared for publication.
