"exploreNCS/" contains scripts and rountines used to explore the CO2 storage
capacity of formations found in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), in
particular the Barents and Norwegian Seas.


----------------------- Trapping Capacities -------------------------------
formationCapacities.m
    - running this script will compute the upper bound (theoretical)
    storage capacities of the Norwegian and Barents Sea formations
    - parameter values required to compute trapping capacities are obtained
    using getSeaInfo()
    - output is given in a table, suitable for a latex document


exploreHammerfestProspects.m
    - running this script will compute storage capacity of specific traps
    in Sto formation, which correspond to those identified in NPD's
    CO2-Atlas
    - data displayed as table suitable for latex document
    - main helper: getProspectTrapIDAndGrids()


----------------------- Injection / Optimization --------------------------
    (Now in a separate folder: /co2lab/experimental/optimization_part2)

exploreOptWellNCS.m
    - optimization of well placement and injection rates
    - getWellInfo() is used to place wells using various options (more
    options can be implemented)
    - can use either rate-controlled or bhp-controlled wells
    - contains some post-processing at end of script
    (should put into the separate _postProc.m file)
    

exploreOptWellNCS_postProc.m
    - post-processing of results obtained using exploreOptWellNCS.m
    - mrst-gui's are launched: plotToolbar(), plotWellSols()


---------------------- Trapping and Injection Scenarios -------------------
exploreNorwegianSea.m
    - exploration of storage capacity or injection scenarios specifically
    applied to Norwegian Sea formations
    - creates plots of formations
    - TODO: getTrappingPlots() should be replaced with getTrappingInfo()


-------------------------- To Merge ---------------------------------------
exploreHammerfest.m (unfinished)
    - explortation of storage capacity in Hammerfest Basin aquifer, located
    in the Barents Sea


exploreGreaterSnohvitField.m (unfinished)
    - exploration of storage capacity in a large structural trap found in
    Hammerfest Basin aquifer, part of the Sto formation
    - could be merged into exploreHammerfest.m ?


--------------- Copies of North Sea scripts - To remove ? -----------------
modelsFromAtlas_BarentsSea.m
    - copy of modelsFromAtlas.m but specific to Barents Sea formations
    - provides plots of formations, trapping estimates, grid property
    summaries


showCO2atlas_BarentsSea.m (to update)
    - copy of showCO2atlas.m but specific to Barents AND Norwegian Sea
    (need to update title)
    - main purpose: to obtain plot of formations along coast of Norway
    - Note: map of Norway is shifted for alignment against formations.
    Shift is different from alignment against North Sea formations.


-------------------------- To Remove --------------------------------------
studyBarentsOrNorwegianSeas.m (to remove)
    - contains redundant parts now present in other scripts, however some 
    output may be useful


studyFormationCapacity.m            (to remove)
studyFormationCapacity_simulation.m (to remove)
    - initial scripts, should be deleted as most of its content is now
    computed in other scripts or routines


studyNPDProspects.m (to remove)
    - copies of other scripts.
