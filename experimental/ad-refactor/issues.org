* Questions
** Should we use ~setupSimComp~ or ~setupSimCompVE~?  In the original code, the comments argue for the former (see ~prepareSimulationSystem~), but right now I don't see a reason (and indeed, choosing the former gives wrong pore volumes).
- for now, I chose to use ~setupSimCompVE~ as this is conceptually the function to use for VE.

* Functions to implement
** DONE constantEOS
** DONE setupFluid
** DONE equationsCO2BrineCompressible
** TODO model.updateState
** TODO nonlinearSolverAdaptiveTimestep




* scratch
** runScheduleRefactor
*** [nonlinear]solver.solveTimestep
**** model.stepFunction (called with the linear solver as an argument)
***** model.getEquations
***** [linear]solver.solveLinearProblem
***** model.updateState 
** What should the nonlinear solver do?
*** save/cache steps, and ability to load cached steps
*** set state.wellSol if control has changed


Endringer i runScheduleRefactor:
  - accept boundary conditions as argument
  - change getWell function
  - set state.wellsol
    - save/cache problematikk
