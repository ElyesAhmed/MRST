# Simulation Tools for H\(_2\) Storage in Depleted Reservoirs Using Fully Compositional MRST-Simulator and Bio-Chemistry Model

This module integrates a bio-chemistry model with the compositional simulator in the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). It implements the Soerinde Whitson (SW) equation of state (EoS), which has been fitted to experimental data. The EoS can also generate tabulated PVT data for black-oil simulators.

## Overview

The purpose of this module is to simulate the phase behavior and thermodynamic properties of hydrogen storage in depleted reservoirs. It specifically accounts for the effects of temperature, pressure, and salinity on bacterial activity and hydrogen loss. 

Key features include:
- **SW EoS**: Fitted to the \( \text{H}_2\text{O-H}_2-\text{CO}_2-\text{CH}_4-\text{N}_2 \) mixture for modeling methanogenesis reactions.
- **Biochemical Reaction**: The following reaction is simulated:
  \[
  4\text{H}_2 + \text{CO}_2 \longrightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy}
  \]

## Prerequisites
