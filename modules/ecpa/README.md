eCPA

An new CPA EoS for CCUS fluids to accurately predict phase equilibria of H2O-CO2-H2S-N2-O2-Ar-SO2-CH4-C2H6-C3H8 systems.
A new method is proposed for solving explicit cross-association equations, and the overall CPU time decreases by 70 % for flash calculations and compositional simulations. 
Extended applicability range of CPA model to CCUS mixtures using vdW mixing rule to replace HV mixing rule.
