* do not compute twice facets and g
* bcetazero not used for coupling terms
* sign of right-handside for mechanics
* check bcetazero in runBiotSim
* rho is not volumetric
* uniformize interface of computeFacetNormals and computeNodeFaceCentroids
* In bc for mpsa, rename bc with bcdir?
* switch to neumann also in flow part in runBiot convergence test
* Change name from runBiotSim to runBiotConvSim (for consistency)
* Comment on fact that Neumann Biot is special
* check bcetazero for biot.
  What do we use? is it consistent between mpsa and mpfa?
* switch to getDispatchInd in blockAssembleMPSA
* use computeConsistentGradient in blockAssemblyMPSA
* add switch for setupTbls (mpfa or mpsa alone)
* document divoperator and computenodedisp in utils
* implement divergence for blockMPSA
* In Tensor Assembly, add check when a matrix in matlab format only is multiplied with a matrix in SparseTensor format only.
  - seems to go wrong (get zero matrix)
* check definition of g
  - in assembly, we do reduction of C and g with respect to coldim. Maybe it should be with respecto to rowdim
* Implement object-setup of crossIndexArray with replacefds1 and replacefds2
* in ooad, include setting of continuity point
  - also bcetazero
* in ad, include nonisotropic perm in mpfa
* in ad for fluid, recover directly pv (withou calling tpfa)
* in setupMpfaOperators, call useVirtual
* add normalization of D for mpfa also in blockassembly
* Assemble stress operator once for all (not each time it is called)
