* do not compute twice facets and g
* bcetazero not used for coupling terms
* sign of right-handside for mechanicss
* check bcetazero in runBiotSim
* rho is not volumetric
* uniformize interface of computeFacetNormals and computeNodeFaceCentroids
* In bc for mpsa, rename bc with bcdir?
* switch to neumann also in flow part in runBiot convergence test
* Change name from runBiotSim to runBiotConvSim (for consistency)
* Comment on fact that Neumann Biot is special
* check bcetazero for biot.
  What do we use? is it consistent between mpsa and mpfa?
