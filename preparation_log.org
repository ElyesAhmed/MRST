* Bring up:
- default sampling for CO2 object?
- include last example of paper2 (not guaranteed to converge)
- is the solution chosen for dsxy2figxy OK?
* Stuff to do
** INMIND Finish off code for paper3 (at least what there is time for)
- last example needs to be tested
** INMIND Last attempt to fix last example of paper2
- can this be made to run if we change timestep size?
** Tidy up code
*** DONE Go through co2lab-ad, reorganise (move to deprecated or elsewhere)
*** DONE Placement of the new code in appropriate places
*** CANCELED +Write READMEs for all the papers+
Not necessary, as there is a common README script for them all.
*** INMIND What to do about the file dsxy2figxy_new ?
- ask Knut-Andreas whether my solution is acceptable
*** Document new code
**** Decide how to deal with the CO2 object, CoolProps and data files
**** Code that needs documentation:
***** DONE getPhaseFluxAndProps_WGVE
***** DONE CO2VEBlackOilTypeModel
***** DONE SampledProp2D
***** DONE CO2props  (add documentation of default ranges!)
***** DONE boCO2
***** generatePropsTable
***** addSampledFluidProperties
***** makeVEFluid
***** runAllExamples_paper1
***** runAllExamples_paper2
***** runAllExamples_paper3
***** runStandardModel
*** Delint
*** Address all @@
*** Run script to remove all trailing whitespace from all m-files
** Run through all examples once more
*** Verify that scripts run even when clear all has been called first, and that all modules are loaded when necessary
*** List of all examples expected to be working

** Other:
- the script 'dissolutionTopSurfaceExample1' doesn't seem to converge properly, and isn't used for any of the illustrations as far as I can see, so it is left out from the final compilation.
