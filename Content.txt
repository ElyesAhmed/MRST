This file briefly describes the content of the the ad-micp module. Inside
the root folder, you will find the following folders:

* examples,
* publications,
* models, and
* utility.

In addition, this file (CONTENT.txt), a copy of the license (LICENSE.txt),
and the README (README.md).

The example folder contains four commented scripts to demonstrate how to set up
different flow system simulations using this module:

* run1DCase.m,
* run2DLeakageCase.m,
* run2DRadialCase.m, and
* run3DCase.m.

The publications folder contains two folders for reproducing the numerical
results in the manuscripts.

* paper_A
* paper_B

The paper_A folder contains the following scripts:

* micp_1Dfhs.m,
* micp_2Dfhcs.m,
* micp_2Dfhrs.m,
* micp_2Dfls.m,
* micp_2Dfvrs.m, and
* micp_3Dfls.m.

The paper_B folder contains the following scripts and folder:

* micp_mrst_opm.m and
* micp_opm_vtk.

The micp_opm_vtk folder contains the data obtained from the OPM simulations
to be used for plotting.

The models folder contains the two parent classes for declaring the CO2 and
MICP models:

* CO2Model.m, and
* MICPModel.m.

Finally, in the utility folder, you will find the following functions:

* checkCloggingMICP.m,
* equationsCO2.m,
* equationsMICP.m,
* getDispersionAnddpWMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsCO2.m,
* getFluxAndPropsMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsWater.m,
* getPlotAfterStepCO2.m,
* getPlotAfterStepMICP.m, and
* mrsttovtk.m.
