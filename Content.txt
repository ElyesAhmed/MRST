This file briefly describes the content of the the ad-micp module. Inside
the root folder, you will find the following folders:

* examples,
* models, and
* utility.

In addition, this file (CONTENT.txt), a copy of the license (LICENSE.txt),
and the README (README.md).

The examples folder contains the scripts to reproduce the numerical results 
in the paper:

* micp_1Dfhs.m,
* micp_2Dfhcs.m,
* micp_2Dfhrs.m,
* micp_2Dfls.m,
* micp_2Dfvrs.m, and
* micp_3Dfls.m.

The models folder contains the two parent classes for declaring the
CO2 and MICP models:

* CO2Model.m, and
* MICPModel.m.

Finally, in the utility folder, you will find the following functions:

* addWellMICP.m,
* co2_2Dfls.m,
* co2_3Dfls.m,
* equationsCO2.m,
* equationsMICP.m,
* getDispersionAnddpWMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsCO2.m,
* getFluxAndPropsMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsWater.m., and
* simulateScheduleADMICP.m.
