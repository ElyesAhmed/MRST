move fluidPart functionality inside of ChemicalTransportModel
    - make work for injected solutions with differing amount of elements
    
if the transport solver creates nan/inf solutions send back to initial guess calculator
    - may require a change to physicalModel
    
give an error if chemical solver does not converge
    - currently if max iterations is exceeded it will just terminate and give no warning
