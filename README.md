# fv-unsat: An MRST module for the equations of unsaturated poroelasticity

## Description
This module implements a discretization of the (three-dimensional) equations of unsaturated poroelasticity using
cell-centered finite volume methods, specifically MPFA-O and MPSA-W. Note that if  mechanical effects are neglected, the set of equations reduce to the well-known Richards' equation. The module is written using the AD-OO approach, aimign at flexibility as its first goal.

There are four numerical examples accompanying this module:
* convAnalysisRE.m
* convAnalysisUnsatBiot.m
* waterInfiltration.m
* desiccationUnsatBiot.m

The first two are convergence tests and the last two are practical applications. Even though the numerical tests are well documented, they are not meant as tutorials, but are rather included for demonstrative purposes. To learn the basics regardign the module usage, we recommend waterInfiltration.m.
